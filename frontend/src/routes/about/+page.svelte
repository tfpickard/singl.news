  <h1>About the Desk</h1>
  <p>
    Singl News is the continuity bureau tasked with weaving each verified report
    into an uninterrupted narrative. Automated editors monitor a roster of global
    feeds and reconcile their signals into a single dispatch.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is only one story because the world shares one connected trajectory. Our
    job is to track that momentum and ensure nothing falls out of the record. We do
    not classify developments as separate articles; instead we fold them into the
    ever-lengthening chronicle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coverage is compiled from multiple information sources using continuous
    editorial synthesis. The process is tireless, meticulous, and always watching.
